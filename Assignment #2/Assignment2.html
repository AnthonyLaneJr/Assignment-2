        Childhood</h2>

    <p class="p1"> 
        During my elementary and middle school years my family always pushed sports onto my brother (Younger) and I. We both played football, basketball, baseball, and tennis.My Family believed that sports would provide structure and instill the concept of hard work into me. So even though I didn't always enjoy the sport I was playing, my parents and grandpa would make sure I gave it my all.

        Early Adult-hood</h2>
    <p class="p2">
        Instead of following my parents wishes and attending college, I enlisted in the Army. In the summer of 2017, just following my Highschool graduation, I shipped off to bootcamp. My first few years in the Army were extremely impactful, it's safe to say that they helped mold me into the man I am today.The experiences I gained and things I saw forever changed the way I viewed life, as well as my goals in life.

        Present Time</h2>

        
     <p class="p3">
        Following my seperation from the military I decided to pursue my passion, Personal Training. As much as I love training clients in a gym, training isn't feasible while working for a large corporation. I've refocused my efforts into learning about coding and website design; in hopes of one day owning my own web-design/IT business.</p>
